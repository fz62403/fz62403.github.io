	<font size="7" face="Georgia, Arial" color="maroon">A</font> desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living
	conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected
	surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the 
	world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs 
	and which are sometimes called polar deserts or "cold deserts". Deserts can be classified by the amount
	of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by 
	their geographical location.</p>

	<img src="the_desert-wide.jpg" alt=”Desert"  height=50%" width="50%" align="right">
	<font size="7" face="Georgia, Arial" color="maroon">D</font>eserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night 
	put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, 
	there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them
	to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the 
	wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms. Wind-blown
	sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and
	the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high
	in billowing sand dunes.</p>
	
	<p> 
	<font size="7" face="Georgia, Arial" color="maroon">O</font>ther deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface
	consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements and little further 
	erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once 
	deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. 
	There may be underground sources of water in the form of springs and seepages from aquifers.	
	Where these are found, oases can occur.</p>
	<p>
	<font size="7" face="Georgia, Arial" color="maroon">P</font>lants and animals living in the desert need special adaptations to survive in the harsh environment.
	Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, water-resistant cuticles and often spines to 
	deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die in the course of a few weeks after rainfall 
	while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture.
	Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade
	or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of 
	their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long
	periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions 
	are favorable before returning to dormancy.</p>
	<p>
	<font size="7" face="Georgia, Arial" color="maroon">P</font>eople have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomads have moved 
	their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled 
	way of life. The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil and is one of the causes of increased 
	desertification. Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation and the Imperial Valley in California provides
	an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many
	trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara Desert, and traditionally were used by caravans 
	of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara.
	Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large
	quantities of solar energy.</p>
